Node has a very expansive ecosystem and a lot of flexibility in how you write your code. For example, there’s a million-and-one tools and packages out there you could implement in an Express app. The best way to grow as a developer and immerse yourself in the ecosystem is to work for a company that works with NodeJS and pays you to learn. If that’s not an option, building your own stuff and reading on your own time can be a good substitute. There’s new information being created every day in blog posts, Stack Overflow posts, and podcasts.
